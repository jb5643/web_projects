    <h3>Rules</h3>
	<p>
		Rule shorthand: A/B
		<br>
		A - each digit represents a number of neighbors for which a 'live' cell will continue onto the next generation, for any other number of neighbors the cell will 'die'.<br>
		B - each digit represents a number of neighbors for which a 'dead' cell will become 'alive' in the next generation.<br>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Neighborhood</h3>
	<p>
		This program uses whats known as the Moore neighborhood (behavior is determined by the states of all 8 surrounding cells).

	<h3>Grid</h3>
	<p>
		The grid in this program does not wrap, therefore any live cells that reach the boundaries die.
